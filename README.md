# Django-Capstone-Project
This project was made in collaboration with a fellow student who worked on a Tableau story that showed the rates army vets can get when they enroll in college.  The rate is based on location and rank.  The website is based in Django and uses Boostrap styles.  It features a guessbook with pagination and some text based pages with additional millitary information.  The guesbook includes features such as email password reset, user profile picture and allows for editing and deleting posts.
